# üöÄ Live Collaborative Code Editor

A real-time, browser-based collaborative code editor built with **React, Node.js, and Socket.IO**. Have you ever wanted to code with your team simultaneously in a shared environment, just like in Google Docs? This application makes it possible, allowing multiple users to join a room and see code changes synced live across all screens.

üîó **Live Demo:** [https://code-editor-pink-ten.vercel.app/](https://code-editor-pink-ten.vercel.app/)

Backend server is usually sleeping due to inactivity, hence wait for a minute after clicking, live demo link. After server starts, all features start working as usual.

3.  **Create your environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file by duplicating the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *No changes are needed in this file for local development.*

4.  **Run the Application:**
    You need to run the backend server and the frontend client in two separate terminals.

    * **Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server**
        ```bash
        npm run server:dev
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

    * **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend Client**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be live at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
