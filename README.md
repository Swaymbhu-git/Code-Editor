# 🚀 Live Collaborative Code Editor

A real-time, browser-based collaborative code editor built with **React, Node.js, and Socket.IO**. Have you ever wanted to code with your team simultaneously in a shared environment, just like in Google Docs? This application makes it possible, allowing multiple users to join a room and see code changes synced live across all screens.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://code-editor-pink-ten.vercel.app/](https://code-editor-pink-ten.vercel.app/)

Backend server is usually sleeping due to inactivity, hence wait for a minute after clicking, live demo link. After server starts, all features start working as usual.

## 🔧 Getting Started Locally

Follow these instructions to run the project on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Swaymbhu-git/Code-Editor.git](https://github.com/Swaymbhu-git/Code-Editor.git)
    cd Code-Editor
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```
    *This uses the `package-lock.json` to ensure exact dependencies are installed.*

3.  **Create your environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file by duplicating the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *No changes are needed in this file for local development.*

4.  **Run the Application:**
    You need to run the backend server and the frontend client in two separate terminals.

    * **Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server**
        ```bash
        npm run server:dev
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

    * **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend Client**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be live at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
