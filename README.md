# üöÄ Live Collaborative Code Editor

A real-time, browser-based collaborative code editor built with the MERN stack. Have you ever wanted to code with your team simultaneously in a shared environment, just like in Google Docs? This application makes it possible, allowing multiple users to join a room and see code changes synced live across all screens.

## üîß Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the project locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    cd CODE-EDITOR-MASTER
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    You need to run the backend server and the frontend client in two separate terminals.

    * **Run the Backend Server:**
        ```bash
        npm run server:dev
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

    * **Run the Frontend Client:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be live at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
